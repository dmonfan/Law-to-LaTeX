with appropriate scientific knowledge, shall establish a Federal

            \item measures of the institution's demonstrated excellence 
        in the education of students in the field of artificial 
        intelligence; and
            \item measures of the institution's ability to attract and 
        retain a diverse and non-traditional student population in the 
        fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics,

        higher education to students who are enrolled in programs of

        with other fields of study, including those that address the

        interaction with AI systems; and
            \item support capacity-building education research programs 
        that will enable postsecondary educational institutions to
